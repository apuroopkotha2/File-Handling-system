# File Handling System
### Summary
This Python project provides a script for organizing files within a specified folder based on a regular expression pattern. The script scans a source folder for files containing the words 'question' or 'questions' in their names (case-insensitive) and moves them to a designated destination folder. The destination folder is automatically created if it doesn't exist.

### Features
Automatic Organization: The script automates the sorting and moving of files based on a customizable regex pattern.

Flexibility: Users can easily customize the source and destination folders, as well as the regex pattern according to their specific requirements.

### Notes
Ensure appropriate permissions for moving files within the specified folders.
It's advisable to test the script on a small set of files initially to avoid unintended file movements.
